# Mind and Body Maintenance

Mind and Body Maintenance is a site that I created to share some of my favourite sources on sleep, exercise and mindfulness. These sources will range from articles, journals, YouTube videos and websites from various experts and content creators. There is also an opportunity for users of the site to suggest their own content and suggestions for the site's function and appearance.

## Features 

Below is a list of features that I have on this site and will detail each indivdually - there is a nav menu for each page, and there are five pages in total - Home, Sleep, Exercise, Mindfulness and a suggestions page. The home page has an aside which also loads up a YouTube video for each section. Within the Sleep, Exercise and Mindfulness pages, there is an iframe, table and list items which link to various external sources. The is a form for the Suggestions page to record data entered by users of the site. Ther is a also a footer which links the user to social media pages.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
