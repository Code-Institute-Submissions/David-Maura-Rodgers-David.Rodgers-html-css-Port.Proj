            <p> There are a lot of websites and YouTube videos out there regarding the importance of exercise, the 
                benefits it confers and the right form to use when performing the movements. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> When it comes to exercise, my favourites are Scooby and Hybrid Calisthenics. They provide a friendly, fun and 
                informative platform for people to learn more about the skills required to exercise in several different ways.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Click on the <a href="exercise.html">Exercise</a> page and I will have more content from the all sources I 
                mentioned. This will be a list of resources including articles, video and studies.

            <p> “Typically, people who exercise, start eating better and becoming more productive at work. They smoke less 
                and show more patience with colleagues and family. They use their credit cards less frequently and say they 
                feel less stressed. Exercise is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change.”

            <p> Mindfulness and mental health is much more talked about than it has ever been before. It is now very much
                a discussion that is being had at work and employers are a lot more concerns with how it affects everone's lives.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> The topic is vast and can cover may different areas - I have chosen to focus on some common topics such as anxiety,
                stress and mindfulness approached to combat these problems.

            <br>
            <p> In the <a href="mindfulness.html">Mindfulness</a> section, in addition, to usual types of sources, I have included 
                a book I read recently which I hope will be of use for others.
