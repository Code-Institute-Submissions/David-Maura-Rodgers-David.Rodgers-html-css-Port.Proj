            <p> "Vulnerability is not winning or losing; it’s having the courage to show up and be seen when we have no control 
                over the outcome. Vulnerability is not weakness; it’s our greatest measure of courage." ― Brene Brown, Author

        <p> There are huge amounts of websites and YouTube videos out there regarding the importance of exercise, the 
            benefits it confers and the right form to use when performing the movements.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Exercise is something I have been interested in for a long time, specifically resistance training, which many
            of the resources within this section are concerened with. My favoutites are Scooby and Hybrid Calisthenics. 
            They provide a friendly, fun and informative platform for people to learn more about the skills required to
            exercise in several different ways.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Click on the <a href="exercise.html">Exercise</a> page and  I will have more content from the all sources I mentioned.
            This will be a list of resources including articles, video and studies.
